		<h2>Decision-Support Framework</h2>
		<p> This decision-support framework aims to assist developers in selecting the appropriate PPML technique for their 
		use case in accordance with user preferences. It was originally developed by Löbner et al. (2024)*. </p>
		<p> The results provide helpful insights for developers for the decision process regarding the PPML technique. </p>
		<p> On this introductory page, the key concepts of the framework and the functionality of the website are presented. </p>
		<h3>The Framework</h3>
		<p>User acceptance criteria are mapped to PPML characteristics in order to determine which characteristics have an 
		impact on the user acceptance of the technology. The framework uses an importance score for user preferences and an 
		assignment of weights to different categories of PPML technique characteristics done by developers to calculate a weighted 
		score for each PPML technique. The scores show which technique suits the use case best in achieving user acceptance. 
		The following flowchart illustrates the framework's steps and the inherent relationships of inputs and outputs. </p>
		<img src="images/process.png" id="framework" alt="Framework Flowchart" style="width: 70%; height: auto;">
		<p>For the mapping of UAC to PPML characteristics, a binary matrix \(F\) is used. <br>
		\(F_{ij}\in\{0,1\}\) represents the relation of the \(j\)-th UAC with the \(i\)-th PPML characteristic with \(0\) standing
		for no connection and \(1\) for an influence of the PPML characteristic on the UAC. <br>
		The UAC scores representing the importance of each UAC are denoted as \(u_j\in[0,1]\) for the score of the \(j\)-th UAC with
		the condition that \(\sum_{j=0}^{J} u_j = 1\). <br>
		Each PPML characteristic can have a number of categories \(k\in[0,\infty)\). The matrix \(X_i\) is then the matrix for the
		\(i\)-th PPML characteristic. The dimension \((m,n)\) represents the categories for the respective PPML characteristic
		\((m)\) (also \(k\)) and the number of PPML techniques assessed \((n)\) (also \(t\)). If a technique fulfills a PPML 
		characteristic category (e.g. the PPML technique FL using aggregation, consequently fulfilling the category <i>'Yes'</i> for the
		<i>'Aggregation'</i> characteristic) \(X_{i,kt} = 1\), otherwise \(0\). <br>
		A weight vector \(y_i\) assigns weights to the categories of the different PPML characteristics to evaluate them against each
		other. The weights can be chosen in the range \(y_{i,k}\in[0,1]\). Categories can be exclusive or not, resulting in the following
		notation:

			\[
			\forall i:
			\begin{cases} 
			\sum_{k=0}^{K} y_{i,k} = 1 \text{  if not exclusive}\\
			\sum_{k=0}^{K} y_{i,k} \geq 1 \text{  if exclusive}
			\end{cases}
			\]

		The user input is then translated into PPML characteristics' scores \(c_i\) for the \(i\)-th PPML characteristic. 
		This score is the dot product of the user preference scores \(u_j\) and the mapping of UAC to PPML characteristics \(F_{i,j}\):

			\[
			c_i:= \sum_{j=0}^{J} F_{i,j}u_{j}
			\]

		Vector \(c\) is then normalised to allow for better comparison of the results: 
		
			\[
			\forall i:\tilde{c_i}:=\frac{c_i}{\sum_{g=0}^{I} c_g}
			\]

		The resulting ranking of the assessed PPML techniques is presented by the evaluation vector \(e\):

			\[
			\forall t:e_t := \sum_{i=0}^{I=13} \tilde{c_i} \cdot (X_i^T \cdot y_i)
			\]

		The highest-ranking PPML technique meets the user preferences best. </p>

		<h3>The Website</h3>
		<p> The website applies the decision-support framework presented above and aims to support developers in assessing which PPML technique
		is adequate for their use case and the future users' preferences to guarantee a maximum level of user acceptance for the application. </p>
		<p> The structure of the website is a split-screen. The left side always represents the input side, while the right side
		of the website immediately shows the recalculated outputs once a change in inputs was made. </p>
		<h4> The Inputs </h4>
		<p> The <b>mandatory</b> input for the framework to be applicable is the UAC importance assessment on the first input page. 
		For this input, the importance of different user acceptance criteria (UAC) has to be determined. The input should reflect
		the future users' preferences and should be obtained by e.g. interviewing potential users. </p>
		<p> The second input is the setting of weights for the categories of different PPML characteristics. Developers should assess
		how beneficial the fulfillment of a certain category by a PPML technique would be for their use case and assign a respective weight.
		Each weight \(w\) for a category \(i\) has to be chosen from the range \(w_i\in[0,1]\). This means that a high weight assigned 
		signalizes that this category of the respective characteristic is assessed by the developers as valuable, while a low weight 
		signalizes little value for the use case. Keep in mind the exclusiveness constraint: Exclusiveness: If the categories for a 
		PPML characteristic are exclusive, this means that only one category can be applicable for a certain PPML technique. Thus, 
		the weight of each category can be selected freely in the range \([0,1]\). However, if the categories are not exclusive, this
		means that multiple categories can be applicable for one PPML technique. To prevent that the score for this characteristics 
		exceeds 1, the sum of all non-exclusive categories has to be 1, so \(\sum_{i=0}^{I} w_i = 1 \). This input is <b>optional</b>
		, meaning that default values are given and can be used by developers. </p>
		<p> As a third input, developers can change the mapping of UAC to PPML characteristics. If a checkbox is ticked, this means 
		that the respective PPML characteristics influences the particular user acceptance criteria. The original mapping is set as 
		a default and can be used by developers as this input is <b>optional</b>.
		<h4> The Outputs </h4>
		<p> The first output is a heatmap, which illustrates the importance of each PPML characteristic on the final ranking of the PPML 
		techiques. Darker colors stand for a greater impact. Additionally, a recommendation for an adequate PPML technique for the 
		inserted inputs is presented at the bottom. </p>
		<p> In contrast to the one-dimensional, linear heatmap, the second output is multi-dimensional. The radar chart uses categories
		to assess the performance of the different PPML techniques in these areas. The radar chart value presented for the respective 
		PPML technique in each of the six groups is the average of all PPML characteristic scores grouped in the respective group. </p>
		<h4> Additional Functionalities </h4>
		<p> Each input and output page have their own help page assigned, which can be opened by clicking on the following symbol: &nbsp;
		<img src="images/question.png" id="helpSymbolLeft" class="helpSymbol" alt="Question Icon"> <br>
		The help pages support the user in utilizing the website by providing further information, explanations and definitions. </p>
		<p> There further exist options to save the inputs and to upload previously saved input files. This enables users to save their 
		changes and continue to work on the later, refine the inputs based on further inquiries or recreate their decision foundation. 
		JSON-files are used for the download function and, in turn, this file format has to be used for the upload to work out. <br></p>
